# EyeLink_SDK_for_Unity
Custom installer for the EyeLink SDK to interface with Unity/C-Sharp

### EyeLink Dev Kit
This is a custom SDK sent by SR Research to add some extra functionality to their C-Sharp interface in order to make it work with both Unity and MonkeyLogic. I do not know if these changes will be ported to the newer versions of their SDKs. 

### Mouse Simulator
This is a neat piece of software that mimics an EyeLink tracker in simulation mode, but running locally on the computer so that eye tracking can be tested without an actual EyeLink computer.
